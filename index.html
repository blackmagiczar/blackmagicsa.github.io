            <h2>Early Life of Daniel Dumile</h2>
            <p>Dumile was born in London on July 13, 1971, the son of a 
                Trinidadian mother and Zimbabwean father. According to 
                Dumile, he was conceived in the United States, and 
                happened to be born in London because his mother was 
                visiting family. As a child, Dumile moved with his 
                family to Long Island, New York; he grew up in Long 
                Beach, New York. He said he had no memory of his 
                London childhood and his parents had no affiliation 
                with British culture. However, he remained a British 
                citizen, never gaining American citizenship.</p>
